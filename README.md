# ReRendering options
More rendering options!

Similar to Dynamic Resolution Extended, this mod also features a settings entry within the settings menu.

Huge thanks to algernon for input, as always check out his other creations!

What is 'ReRendering Options'? It's a mod that allows you to switch different Unity QualitySettings within the game UI with the purpose of saving on performance.

NOTE: Some options are forced tuned which means they cannot be changed on settings menu as of now, in future updates I plan to expand on functionality. In the future it might be possible to merge DynamicResolutionExtended into this mod instead.

This mod makes 'Performance Squeezer' deprecated as this mod and Dynamic Resolution Extended have the same features.

This mod utilizes algernon's Localization framework and you're more than welcome to contact me/make push request with additional changes.

# Usage


Find 'ReRendering Options' section in the settings menu.

Within here you can find a base option which is 'Force Low Global Quality', don't be scared!

The other options are within the Advanced tab, to show them, click 'Show Advanced'

This mod has been labelled as TEST and it's obviously not the final release. 
# NOTE
With v1.2 you can now export/import your settings to share with others.

Location is here:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Cities Skylines II. Find "ROSettings.xml"
To import settings, simply replace that file with your file.


I, Nyoko have constructed this code, drawing from Algernon's 529 Lites code as its foundation.

Explicit prohibition against redistributing any monetary aspects. This mod can also be found at SkyLinx, display only.
